  This interactive graphing tool presents discrete water-quality
  data collected by the Bureau of Reclamation and USGS at Klamath Basin sites.
  The USGS and Reclamation data stored in NWIS are accessible using existing
  tools such as <a href="http://waterdata.usgs.gov/or/nwis/" target="_blank">NWIS-Web</a>
  and the <a href="http://or.water.usgs.gov/grapher/" target="_blank">USGS Data
  Grapher</a> system. Although these tools are useful, the NWIS-Web interface is still
  evolving and improving. A
  <a href="http://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/index.html" target="_blank">map-based 
  interface to NWIS</a> is available and useful, but that interface does not provide any
  new functionality to quickly view and explore datasets. This interactive graphing tool
  presents discrete water-quality information that have been collected at a single site
  so that the user can quickly focus on a point of interest and examine it further.

  Users are cautioned to consider the nature of the information
  presented here before making decisions using it that concern personal
  or public safety or the conduct of business that involves substantial
